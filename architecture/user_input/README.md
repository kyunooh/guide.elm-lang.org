# Elm 아키텍처 + 사용자 입력

여러분의 웹앱은 사용자의 입력을 처리해야 할 거에요.Your web app is going to need to deal with user input. This section will get you familiar with The Elm Architecture in the context of things like:

* Buttons
* Text Fields
* Check Boxes
* Radio Buttons
* etc.

We will go through a few examples that build knowledge gradually, so go in order!

## Follow Along

In the last section we used `elm-repl` to get comfortable with Elm expressions. In this section, we are switching to creating Elm files of our own. You can do that in [the online editor](http://elm-lang.org/try), or if you have Elm [installed](../../install.md), you can follow [these simple instructions](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial#run-the-examples) to get everything working on your computer!
